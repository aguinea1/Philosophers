**Philosophers** is a classic concurrency problem implementation, created in C. This project simulates the behavior of philosophers sitting at a table, thinking, eating, and competing for limited resources (forks). It's an essential project to understand race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization techniques using **threads** and **processes**.

## ‚Ä∫ Features
- üçù Simulates the **Dining Philosophers Problem** in real-time
- üßµ Implements thread-based concurrency with **mutexes**
- üß™ Bonus version using **processes** and **semaphores**
- üõë Avoids **deadlocks** and **starvation**
- üîß Parameterized execution: number of philosophers, time to eat/sleep/die
- üìö Solid practice in synchronization and systems-level programming

## ‚Ä∫ Project Overview

	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/An_illustration_of_the_dining_philosophers_problem.png" alt="Dining Philosophers Problem" width="200"/>
</p>

In this simulation:
- Each philosopher is represented by a **thread** or **process**
- Forks are shared resources requiring proper **locking mechanisms**
- The program ensures that no philosopher **dies from starvation**
- Includes a **monitoring system** to check for philosopher death and manage simulation flow

# How to Use
 ## ‚Ä∫ Run with threads (mandatory)
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]

‚Ä∫ Example
./philo 5 800 200 200

## ‚Ä∫ Run with processes (bonus)
./philo_bonus <same_arguments_as_above>

## ‚Ä∫ Arguments

| Argument                                | Description                                            |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `number_of_philosophers`               | Number of philosophers and forks                      |
| `time_to_die`                          | Time (ms) a philosopher can go without eating         |
| `time_to_eat`                          | Time (ms) spent eating                                |
| `time_to_sleep`                        | Time (ms) spent sleeping                              |
| `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` | (Optional) Stops the simulation once all have eaten this many times |

## ‚Ä∫ Bonus Version

The bonus challenge is to implement the same logic using **processes** instead of threads. Each philosopher runs in its **own process**, communicating via **semaphores** to manage forks and logging.
